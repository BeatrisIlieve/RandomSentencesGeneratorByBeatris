## Solution
### The Generator is based on the following model:
 1. **Who** = `Name` from `Place`
 - Names = {Marilyn Monroe, Donald Trump, Adolf Hitler, Albert Enstein,...}
 - Places = {Camelot, Arcadia, El Dorado, Fairy Land,...}
 
 2. **Action** = `Verb` + `Noun` + 'Adverb`
 - Verbs = {approaches, bounces back, catapults at, chases after,...}
 - Nouns = {a history, an art, some information, the government,...}
 - Adverbs = {cautiously, enthusiastically, gently, doubtfully,...}
 3. **Details** = {at a nearby farm, by the side of the river, in the mountains, in the toy department,...}
